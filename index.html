    <h1>Reggie Philpott Lab 1</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Reggie Philpott. I am a UC grad but I have come back to school to get a
        degree in IT. My previous degree was in English Literature. This is the beginning of
        my third semester since coming back to school. The only experience I have in web
        development is from the Fundamentals of Web Development class that I took last semester.
